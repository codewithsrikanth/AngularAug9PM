Typescript: Javascript + Datatype

Limitations of Javascript:
- Javascript is not a type safe programming langauge.
- It is not a compiler based language.
- Writing plain JS code will be very difficult.
- Debugging is also a tadious task for the developer.

Advatnages:
- It is not a replacement of JS, rather it si not adding any new features to the javascript.
- The typed javascript is nothing but typescript
- Typescript = Javascript + Datatype
- Once if the TS file is compoiled it generates Javascript

Variables:
    var/let variablename:datatype = value;
    - var and let are the two keywords which can be used to define the variables.
    - let is blocked scope variable, becasue it wont impact the value of another block.
    - Once we define a variable within the block by using let keyword, we can't redeclare it.

Datatypes:
- It is used to specify what type of value a variable can hold.
- In typescript we have two types like
    - Basic Types: Which can hold a single value
        - number
        - string
        - boolean
    - Complex Types: Which can hold multiple values
        - Arrays
        - Tuple
        - Enum

Control Structres:
- Based on condition if we want to execute some block of statements
    - Conditional statements 
        - Simple if 
        - If else
        - If else ladder
        - Switch   
    - Loops
        - for   
        - while
        - do while
        - for..in
        - for..of

Functions:
- A function is a reusable block of code which can be called again and again when it requires.
- In Javascript as it supports OOPS, everything we have to define by using "function" keyword.
- It is one of the limitation of the Javascript, to overcome that we use OOPS with typescript like

Class:
    - Define a Class   
    - Class Properties
    - Constructor
    - Methods
    - Objects
    - Call the members

OOPS: Any programming is called as an OOPS it supports 4 features   
    - Encapsulation
    - Abstraction
    - Polymorphism
    - Inheritence

- Class: In TS a class is a datatype which can be having properties and methods.
- Contructor: A constructor is a sepcial function, which can be used to initilize the data to the class members.
- We can have only one constructor.
- To access the class members we use "this" keyword.
